                <p>Voluntary commitments on AI are insufficient, for a technology that Nobel Prize winners, and even CEOs acknowledge poses an extinction risk to humanity at the same scale as pandemics and nuclear wars.</p>
                <p>Most narrow AI applications are beneficials, from cancer scanning to protein development.</p>
                <p>General AI systems pose extreme risks that countries around the world have committed to mitigating: we must move from voluntary commitments to regulatory oversight, no less than what we expect for safety critical industries like civil, aviation, and nuclear.</p>
